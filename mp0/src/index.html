    I am the ant man. I love ants. I put them everywhere. Did you know you can just buy ants? As many as you want, provided you have the money. I love money.
    Money gets me ants. My dream is to get every single ant and put them in my neighbor Keith's house.

    Keith doesn't like ants so I'm trying to introduce him gradually. I started by putting them in his pool to show him that ants are just fun little guys
    that like to swim, but I'm trying to work my way up to bigger things like filling his gutters and plumbing with ants. I don't do it for the recognition
    but out of the goodness of my heart. Keith doesn't know that I am the ant man, but I hope the kindness I have shown him will stir his heart to do the
    same for others.
